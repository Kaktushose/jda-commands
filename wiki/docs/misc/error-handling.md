# Error Handling

## Exceptions
JDA-Commands defines a set of custom runtime exceptions that can occur:
 
- <com.github.kaktushose.jda.commands.exceptions.ConfigurationException> will be thrown if anything goes wrong while configuring JDA-Commands.
- <com.github.kaktushose.jda.commands.exceptions.InvalidDeclarationException> will be thrown if any errors are made in the declaration of interactions.
- <com.github.kaktushose.jda.commands.exceptions.InternalException> will be thrown if anything goes wrong internally. These errors should be [reported](https://github.com/Kaktushose/jda-commands/issues/new) to the devs.

If a <com.github.kaktushose.jda.commands.exceptions.ConfigurationException>
or <com.github.kaktushose.jda.commands.exceptions.InvalidDeclarationException>
occurs during startup, JDA-Commands will shut down itself as well as JDA. To disable this behaviour, set <JDACBuilder#shutdownJDA(boolean)>
to `false`. 

## Error Messages
As mentioned before, JDA-Commands has a set of error messages it uses all over the place. These messages include:

- Command Execution Failed Message (used for Exceptions)
- Constraint Failed Message (see [Validators](../middlewares/validator.md))
- Cooldown Message (see [Command Cooldown](../middlewares/cooldown.md))
- Insufficient Permissions Message (see [Permissions System](../middlewares/permissions.md))
- Timed Out Component Message (see [Runtime Concept](../start/runtime.md#components-and-modals))
- Type Adapting Failed Message (see [Type Adapters](../middlewares/typeadapter.md))

You can customize these error messages by providing an implementation of <ErrorMessageFactory>.
You have to register it at the JDA-Commands Builder:
```java
JDACommands.builder(jda, Main.class)
    .errorMessageFactory(new OwnErrorMessageFactory());
    .start();
```
Or use the `@Implementation` annotation (requires the [Guice Extension](../di.md#implementation-annotation)):
```java
@Implementation
public class OwnErrorMessageFactory implements ErrorMessageFactory {...}
```

To make things easier, these error messages can also be loaded from a `JSON` source using the [Embed API](../message/embeds.md). 
Therefore, you have to pass an <EmbedDataSource> to the <EmbedConfig>.
```java
JDACommands.builder(jda, Main.class)
    .embeds(config -> config.errorSource(EmbedDataSource.file(Path.of("errorEmbeds.json")))
    .start();
```
The template for the error messages can be found [here](https://github.com/Kaktushose/jda-commands/blob/main/core/src/examples/embeds.json).
The `{ $placeholders }` can be placed anywhere in the embeds and will get injected by JDA-Commands.
