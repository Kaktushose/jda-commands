# JDA-Commands

A declarative, annotation driven interaction framework for JDA. Our goal is to remove any boilerplate code, so 
you can focus solely on the business logic of your bot - writing bots has never been easier:

=== "Code"
      ```java
      @Interaction
      public class CookieClicker {
      
          private int counter;//(1)!
      
          @Command(value = "cookie clicker", desc = "Play cookie clicker")
          public void onClicker(CommandEvent event) {
              event.with().components("onCookie").reply("You've got %s cookie(s)!", counter);
          }
      
          @Button(value = "Collect", emoji = "üç™", style = ButtonStyle.SUCCESS)
          public void onCookie(ComponentEvent event) {
              event.reply("You've got %s cookie(s)!", ++counter);//(2)!
          }
      }
      ```

      1. Yes, that's right! We can store the `counter` as a class variable. JDA-Commands will create a new instance of
      `CookieClicker` for every command execution, so you don't need to worry about state. You can read more about 
      it [here](./start/runtime.md).
      2. This will edit the original message and will also keep the `üç™ Collect` button attached. You can find find more 
      about building replies [here](./interactions/reply.md).
