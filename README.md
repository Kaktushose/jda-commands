## Features

- Simple and intuitive syntax following an annotation-driven and declarative style


- Built-in support for slash commands, components, context menus and modals


- Automatic and customizable type adapting and constraint validation of parameters


- Expandable executing chain (Middleware API)


- Multithreaded event handling using VirtualThreads

---

The following example will demonstrate how easy it is not only to write commands, but also to integrate components with them:

```java
@Interaction
public class CookieClicker {

    private int count;

    @SlashCommand(value = "cookie clicker", desc = "Play cookie clicker")
    public void onClicker(CommandEvent event) {
        event.with().components("onCookie", "onReset").reply("You've got %s cookie(s)!", count);
    }

    @Button(value = "Collect", emoji = "üç™", style = ButtonStyle.SUCCESS)
    public void onCookie(ComponentEvent event) {
        count++;
        event.reply("You've got %s cookie(s)!", count);
    }

    @Button(value = "Reset", emoji = "üîÑ", style = ButtonStyle.DANGER)
    public void onReset(ComponentEvent event) {
        count = 0;
        event.reply("You've got %s cookie(s)!", count);
    }
}
```

Finally, start the framework by calling:

```java
JDACommands.start(jda, Main.class);
```
